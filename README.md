# [How to Webdev](http://boilercamp.github.io/how-to-webdev)

A mostly complete introduction into web development.

It can be difficult to figure out where to start when you want to get into web
development. How to Webdev is a series of accelerated workshops and projects
that build on one another with the goal of teaching web development. This course
will cover [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML),
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript),
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

How to Webdev was first debuted September 2015 at [BoilerCamp](http://boilercamp.org/)
at Purdue University.

Written and developed by [Kirby Kohlmorgen](http://kirby.xyz/) & [Roy Fu](http://royfu.me/).

## The Goal

By the end of this tutorial you should have a sound understanding of how to
build an application for the web. Specifically, in this exercise you'll be
building a personal website and blog.

You'll start by building a static website with vanilla HTML and CSS. We'll
quickly introduce the power of frameworks by hooking you up with some [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
We'll add a little client-side JavaScript, which will give us a chance to
introduce [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). Once we have a pretty static site set
up we'll the introduce the idea of a backend with Node.js running a webserver
with [Express](http://expressjs.com/). This provides us with a nice segway into
server-side rendering and templating [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/). And
finally with introduce the idea of a database utilizing MongoDB.

You can see an example of the finished web app [here](http://ricksanchez.herokuapp.com/).
